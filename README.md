# loan_prediction_ApplAi
In machine learning workshop by ApplAi "Student Activity at Ain Shams University" lasted 2 weeks.. This project aims to predict if the loan will be accepted or not. I do this by using a labeled data for applicants who apply for a loan in the past and analyze these data and use some classification models on it to be able to predict accurately.
