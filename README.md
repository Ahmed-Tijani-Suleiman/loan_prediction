# loan_prediction_ApplAi
In machine learning workshop by ApplAi "Student Activity at Ain Shams University" lasted 2 weeks.. This project aims to predict if the loan would be accepted or not. I do this by using a labeled data for applicants who apply for a loan in the past and analyze these data and use some classification models on it.<br>
I used :
- ✅ Logistic Regression
- ✅ KNN
- ✅ SVM
- ✅ ID3
- ✅ Random Forrest
